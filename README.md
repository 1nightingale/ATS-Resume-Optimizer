## üöÄ How to Run with Your Own API Key

This project is designed to be run in a development environment that supports environment variables (like a local development server or a cloud-based IDE).

To use your own Google Gemini API key, follow these steps:

1.  **Get a Gemini API Key**: If you don't have one, you can get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

2.  **Set the Environment Variable**: You must create an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The application is hard-coded to read the key from `process.env.API_KEY`.

    For example, if you are using a terminal, you might run:
    ```bash
    export API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    Or, if your development environment uses a `.env` file, you would create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following line:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    **Note**: The method for setting environment variables can vary depending on your specific development setup. Please consult the documentation for your tool of choice.

3.  **Run the Application**: Once the `API_KEY` is set, you can start the development server. The application will automatically use your key to communicate with the Gemini API.
